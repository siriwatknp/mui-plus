When ask to build a block for the registry, do the following:

- create a block at `registry/new-york/blocks/{block}/{block}.tsx`.
  - all of the components used in the block must come from Material UI `@mui/material` unless third-party lib is specifically asked.
  - always use `mui-docs-mcp` when building the block to get the most up-to-date documentation about Material UI and its ecosystem.
  - use module export (don't use default export).
  - always attach "use client" directive at the top of the block file.
- render the block to @page.tsx as first item.
- update [registry.json](mdc:registry.json) to include the new block.

After created the block, check the localhost to see if the new block appear on the screen or not.
