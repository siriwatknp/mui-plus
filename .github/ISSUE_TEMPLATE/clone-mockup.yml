        ## ðŸ¤– For Claude

        @claude - Please read the screenshot above and:
        1. Analyze the UI design and structure
        2. Create a new registry item (block or component as specified)
        3. Follow the MUI Registry guidelines in CLAUDE.md
        4. Ensure Material UI components are used
        5. Implement dark mode support, responsive design, and accessibility by default
        6. Update registry.json with the new item metadata
        7. Create a demo page in `app/{name}/page.tsx` if it's a block
        8. Run `pnpm registry:build` to generate the JSON file
        9. Create a PR with the implementation

        The implementation should match the visual design as closely as possible while following MUI best practices and guidelines from CLAUDE.md.
